                Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through
                centuries of
                political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan is based on rice with miso
                soup and other
                dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients.
